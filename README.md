### Welcome

I studied neuroscience and behavior at Harvard Medical School with [Bob Datta](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/research/behavioral-analysis/).

I'm interested in the intersection between machine learning and biology.

Check out [my website](https://wingillis.github.io/) for more info about me.
